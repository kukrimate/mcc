# mcc
This is my C99 hobby compiler.

# structure
Each stage so far is implemented as a (mostly) standalone library in `lib`
with the driver program(s) in `src`.

# project state
So far most of the required pre-processor functionality is working and the
parser is being worked on.

# copying
You probably can get a better compiler, under a less-restrictive license elsewhere.
If you are still interested in using this one, you can do so under version 2 of the GPL.
